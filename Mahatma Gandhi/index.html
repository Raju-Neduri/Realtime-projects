            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which he called Satyagraha, was influenced by his Hindu faith and his belief in ahimsa (nonviolence). He used nonviolent civil disobedience to challenge British rule in India and to advocate for the rights of the Indian people.</p>
            <p>One of his most famous quotes is "Be the change you wish to see in the world."</p>
